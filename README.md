# voxel
A "Minecraft clone" to further experiment with C++. Utilizes OpenGL, GLUT, and the FastNoise libraries.

#What this isn't:
1. Extremely efficient or well-planned.
2. For profit.
..* This is very-much so an experiment.
3. A full game.

#What this is:
1. An experiment to explore the C++ language, native OpenGL bindings, procedural world generation, and optimizations that can be made to a voxel engine.
2. An attempt at achieving high rendering performance.
3. An experiment. It's a toy.

#Logistics
The game is written in C++ using SFML, and OpenGL (and GLUT) for display. These libraries are assumed to be installed on the machine. Roughly, you must install the following packages:
* libsfml-dev
* freeglut3-dev

The game was developed on a low-quality laptop with the following specs:
* Intel Core i5-4210U CPU @ 1.70GHz × 4
* Intel Haswell Mobile  GPU
* 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

Typically, performance is approximately 250-500FPS.
